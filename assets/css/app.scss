@title Methodology
## Code style rules
### Block indentation
Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by **_two spaces_**. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.

### Color Variables
Each color that is used more than once should be placed in a variable in `color.css`.

### File structure
* __/__
* __assets__
  * __scss__ 
  * __styleguide__ 
* __build__ 
  * __styleguide__ 
* __node_modules__
* __gulpfile.js__ 
* __package.json__

### Preprocessor
We use postcss as a preprocessor.

## Class naming conventions
To make sure our CSS is structured we use the _**BEM naming convention**_. The BEM naming convention distinguishes between blocks, elements and modifiers.

_**Blocks**_ are independet and named with a short class name

	<div class="site-search">...</div>

_**Elements**_ are parts of blocks and can't be used by themselves
```html
<div class="site-search">
    <input type="text" class="site-search__field">
    <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="site-search__button">
</div>
```

_**Modifiers**_ change the look of blocks or elements
```html
<div class="site-search site-search--full">
    <input type="text" class="site-search__field">
    <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="site-search__button">
</div>
```
